# Lab 05 - Exercise

The goal of this lab is to combine everything that you have learned in the 
previous labs and put it into practice.

Using all the best-practices (labels, users, size, user,...) create a Docker 
image that holds the code (from the cloud-native-practical exercise).

Once you have created it, push it to your Docker Hub account and share it over 
Slack so your colleagues can check you creation.  Also list the `docker images` 
output in Slack so we can see who created the smallest image.
